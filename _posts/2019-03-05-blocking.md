In India when ISPs block a website all they do is:
1.  Remove website from their DNS ([What is a DNS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rck3BALhI5c "What's a DNS?")) 
2. Block http traffic.

So if we use private DNS like OpenDns, Cloudflare DNS or Google DNS and force HTTPS on our browsers we can access blocked websites.
