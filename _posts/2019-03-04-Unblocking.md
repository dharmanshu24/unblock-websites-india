Follow the Guide for respective device/OS

If you have a Router you can change DNS server in your Router Settings and DNS requests for all devices connected to it will go to that DNS.

Even though in most of guides DNS is changed to GoogleDNS I would recommend you to change your DNS to Cloudflare DNS as it is faster and better for you privacy.
